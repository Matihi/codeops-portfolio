### Route Strategies

- / — static — response does not depend on the request.
- /\_not-found — static — response does not depend on the request.
- /cart — CSR — page is rendered and updated in the browser.
- /checkout — dynamic (SSR) — makes `cookies()` read.
- /login — static — response does not depend on the request.
- /menu — static with revalidation (ISR) — menu data is regenerated at most once per hour.
- /menu/[slug] — static via params (SSG) — pages are generated for the known menu slugs at build time.
- /register — static — response does not depend on the request.
